# `RH_1.0p` Red Herring

Pint-sized mag-fed powerhouse hitting 220+ FPS, all while being operated *entirely* with one hand. Can be disassembled and reassembled without any tools in about 12 seconds.

## What is this?

The Red Herring is a magazine-fed spring-powered blaster that is designed for use with one hand.

This blaster does not compromise on performance and can hit upwards of 220 FPS without becoming impossible to prime. It is also capable of making accurate cross-field tags. This is in contrast to hammer-action blasters that are limited by piston volume and thumb strength, as well as flywheel blasters that are generally not as accurate as springers.

## Why did you make this?

The Captain Slug Piranha 2m was a blaster designed with a similar use case in mind, but I was never happy with how mine worked. The Red Herring was designed to do everything better than the Piranha; it is lighter, smaller, safer, cheaper, and simpler.

## Single Hand Operation - Why is this blaster useful?

**The short version:** You can now run a Worker Nightingale, shield, sword, or other item alongside a no-compromises 220 FPS springer.

Having an extra hand free during a game has a ton of utility, get creative and see what you can come up with!

My personal favorite way to run this blaster is to keep a pool noodle sword attached to my belt rig as a more reliable and courteous way of tagging people at close range, as opposed to point-blanking them with something that can hit over 200 FPS. Getting hit with something that hard from that close is painful, and jams or misfeeds could screw you over in what would otherwise have been a very quick and simple play. If your blaster jams, you will be tagged out. Pool noodles don't jam or hurt people.

Flag pushes during Capture the Flag leave the runner vulnerable as they have to dedicate at least one hand to carrying the flag. Flywheels are usually a good choice for pushes as they are better at keeping opponents back and taking out anyone who happens to be in the general direction you fire, but having a springer opens up some interesting new possibilities if you can pick off other springer users trying to guard the flag areas.

In other games that involve carrying objects, you will be able to outrange any flywheel players who also happen to be carrying things. My group has a game mode called Ultradash where each team is given a beacon that flashes and changes colors. Points are scored by running the beacon to the corresponding color station on the field, then repeating for whatever color it flashes next. I ran a Red Herring prototype during this game and absolutely *dominated* as runner because I was able to tag out springer users when I saw them before they saw me; the colors are randomized and there's no way to know where a runner may pop out from next.
