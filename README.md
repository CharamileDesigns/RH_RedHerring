# `RH_1.0p` Red Herring

Pint-sized Talon-fed powerhouse hitting 220+ FPS, all while being operated *entirely* with one hand. Can be gutted and reassembled without any tools in about 12 seconds.

## What is this?

Have you ever wanted to snipe with one hand?

The Red Herring is a Talon-fed spring blaster that is designed for one-handed use. Despite being about half the size of a Talon Claw, this thing has enough punch to make the cross-field shots that Hammershots can only dream of.

## Why did you make this? 

The Captain Slug Piranha 2m was a blaster designed with a similar use case in mind, but I was never happy with how mine worked. Red Herring was designed from the ground up to be a better Piranha.

Safer, simpler, lighter, cheaper, and more efficient. 

## Single Hand Operation - Why is this blaster useful?

**The short version:** You can now hold a flag, shield, or Worker Nightingale while using a no-frills 220 FPS springer.

Having an extra hand free during a game has a ton of utility, get creative and see what you can come up with!

My personal favorite way to run this blaster is to keep a pool noodle sword attached to my belt rig as a more reliable and courteous way of tagging people at close range; nobody likes getting point-blanked at 200 FPS. Getting hit with something that hard from that close is painful, and jams or misfeeds can screw over an otherwise effective flank. Melee never jams, and frantically waving a sword around is a fantastic way to catch people off guard during a flank!

The most exhilerating thing I have tried has been running a stockless Gryphon in my other hand. Flywheel volume and springer distance at the same time is just too much fun; you can go from back-and-fowrward with an opponent's Caliburn to bum rushing them before they even know what you're doing, while *still* being able to return a shot or two from your own springer.

Games that involve carrying an object such as Carpe or Capture the Flag usually favor flywheelers. Until now, they were the only effective blasters that could be used while carrying things. Red Herring takes that dynamic and flips it on its head; you are now capable of outranging any runners on the field while also being a runner yourself. 

## Tool-free disassembly

This blaster is designed with a springloaded latch at the front that allows the barrel to be detached with a click and a twist, after which the entire plunger assembly can be dumped out the front for cleaning and spring swaps. Reassembly takes less than 20 seconds; my spring swap time trial record is 12.
